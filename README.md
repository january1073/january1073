# Hi there!üëã

I'm Tim and a lawyer specialising in information security.

In my spare time I try to code a little. Here I share what works. Although I work with GenAI a lot on a daily basis, the code, scripts and snippets shared here are üíØ% handmade.

It's not much yet -- but there is more to come soon ...
